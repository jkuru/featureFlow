/**
 * Role of DFComponentStateStore
 * The DFComponentStateStore is designed as the single source of truth for the raw, application-wide state of features. Hereâ€™s what it does:
 *
 * Centralized State Management: It holds the installation states (InstallationState) and interceptor states (InterceptorState) for all features, accessible across the app.
 * Persistence: It uses SharedPreferences to store data like the last attempted URI, ensuring durability across app restarts.
 * Raw Data: It provides states like NotInstalled, Installing, Installed, or Failed, which reflect the actual status of feature installations.
